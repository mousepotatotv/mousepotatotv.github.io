If you don't know who I am (which let's face it is fairly likely, it's a big old world out there) I stream on Twitch as [MousePotato](https://twitch.tv/mousepotato), where I mostly play spacey games like [Elite: Dangerous](http://elitedangerous.com) and MMO games like [Elder Scrolls Online](http://elderscrollsonline.com).

I'm also a proud member of [The Sovereignty](http://the-sov.com), a large community of like minded gamers with a focus of friendliness and good humanity. Each year we run the [Project 168](https://twitter.com/project168_) event and try to raise a bunch of monies for charity.

If you want to know anything else, [come ask me](https://twitch.tv/mousepotato) - I'm a fairly open book.
