Yes yes, this is _yet another_ streaming setup guide. But the thing about these guides is that you can cherry pick from other people's setups and figure out a system that _really_ works for you. So here's mine, have at it.

**Note: this is currently an unfinished work in progress**

## Overview

I run a single PC setup with two monitors and two soundcards, configured in such a way that I can use my system for more than just streaming, and can use my hardware for listening to music, watching movies, and for plugging in instruments and other external audio devices.

## Requirements

When designing my setup, I wanted:

* My primary monitor dedicated to games, and a secondary monitor to observe stream status, chat, etc.
* A headset microphone when head tracking so my voice level doesn't change as I look around, and a better quality static microphone for everything else.
* To be able to independently manage audio channels such as microphone, voice chat, music and desktop sounds.
* To be able to use my speakers without feedback from my microphone.
* To be able to plug in musical instruments and other external audio devices and play them through my speakers.
* To be able to control as much as possible without having to click around between applications.
